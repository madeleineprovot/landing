		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Logipub is proposing a service for the provision of advertising media on professional vehicles.Logistics and transport companies are finding it increasingly difficult to make a profit in the face of rising costs (energy, tolls, human resources). On the other hand, advertising agencies or consumer companies are constantly looking for new communication channels.There is therefore a need between these two sectors of activity. OOH (Out Of Home) corresponds to all advertising that a consumer may come across outside the home.Logipub's idea is therefore to develop MOOH (Mobile Out Of Home) which will correspond to mobile advertising on French roads. This will be made possible by trackers and data analysis in order to develop the reach of the audience of each vehicle according to their route, time and date.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>Wich Activity?</h2>
		    <p>The concrete objective of logipub is to manage the relationship with the advertising agencies or marketing departments of companies on the one hand and the transport companies on the other. The activity is therefore divided intotwo business units. The first will be to analyse the needs of advertisers (target audience, geographical area, display duration, budget, fleet deployed) in terms of advertising. Logipub therefore acts as a manager. We will propose mobile advertising spaces to advertisers.

		   	<h3>Why call on us?</h3>
		   	<p>Auchan realised that these advertisements were no longer reaching enough of its consumers and was looking for a new means of communication targeted at the northern region. It contacted an advertising agency such as Publicis to remedy these problems. Auchan want to let people know that a kilo of orange is at €2.99 in all supermarkets in the North until the beginning of the summer.Publicis has a budget of €15,000 for the Auchan campaign, and contacted us to run the campaign. On our side, we contacted all the partner logistics companies located in the Northern region to find out if we were able to carry out this campaign with the visibility requested by Auchan. Using our data on the visibility of trucks in the North, we decided to put an X number of trucks on the campaign and to stick the stickers corresponding to the Orange promotion at Auchan during the period required to achieve the visibility requested by Publicis and Auchan.
